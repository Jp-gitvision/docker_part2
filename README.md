ðŸ’ª Challenge
Take an existing Nodejs app and dockerize it
Make a Dockerfile, then built it, push it to dockerhub (free personnal account) and run it
Remove your image from local cache and run it from dockerhub
Create a postgres version 13.6 container with named volume (give any name / you can use dockerhub to learn about the volume path and version needed for postgres)
check the logs and stop the container
Create a new posgres container with the same named volume using version 14.2
check the logs again, what have you noticed?
